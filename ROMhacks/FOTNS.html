								<h3>Why “Last Battle / Hokuto no Ken”?</h3>
								<p>The original Japanese release of Hokuto no Ken had several intriguing aspects that drew me in:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Cultural and artistic alterations:</strong> The game was heavily altered for its Western 
										release (<em>Last Battle</em>), losing its <em>Fist of the North Star</em> license, iconic 
										“exploding heads,” and original character designs.</li>
									<li><strong>Potential for improvement:</strong> As a launch title, the game had the potential to be enjoyable 
										but was plagued by issues such as unbalanced boss fights and the absence of a life system, leaving players 
										with only one chance to complete the entire game.</li>
									<li><strong>Untapped opportunity:</strong> Surprisingly, no ROM hacks or proper English translations of the 
										Japanese version were available at the time.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>What began as a simple translation project quickly evolved. As I explored the game’s original code, I 
									uncovered numerous bugs and design flaws. Seeing these as opportunities to learn, I pushed myself further 
									with each discovery. The result was not just a translation but a comprehensive overhaul of the game, enhancing 
									its balance, fixing bugs, and restoring its authenticity.</p>
								
								<h3>Media Coverage</h3>
								<p>This project gained media attention and was featured in an article by <em>Time Extension</em>, which praised 
									the patch as a "major overhaul" of the Japanese original. The article highlighted how the project addressed 
									long-standing issues in gameplay balance, narrative consistency, and overall presentation.
									The improvements have resonated with fans, earning positive feedback from the community.</p>
								
								<p>One review on ROMHacking.com says: <br>    
								<em>"I remember buying Last Battle when it launched. It looked so awesome to my 12-year-old eyes. It ended up 
									being a frustratingly difficult and slightly slow game. I am happy to report that the improvements made to 
									Hokuto no Ken, coupled with the translation, have swept away the buyer’s remorse I had experienced back 
									then."</em></p>

								<h3>Patch Notes</h3>
								<p>The ROM hack builds upon the original Japanese release of <em>Hokuto no Ken</em>, enhancing gameplay with 
									bug fixes, redesigned dungeons, and an updated HUD. It introduces new features such as a life system, 
									power-ups, and a high-score save function, while also restoring elements lost in its Western counterpart, 
									<em>Last Battle</em>.</p>
